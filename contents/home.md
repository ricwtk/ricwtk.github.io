My name is Richard Wong. I was trained as a mechatronic engineer during my undergraduate and just received my leave to supplicate for my D.Phil (Ph.D.) in Engineering Science from the University of Oxford. My thesis title is **Speed Control for Low-Energy On-Time Buses**. When I was doing D.Phil in the University of Oxford, I was with the [Energy and Power Group (EPG)](//epg.eng.ox.ac.uk).

I am enthusiastic about coding, machine learning, and optimisation. My preferred programming language is Python but I am also well exposed to Matlab, C++, HTML5, CSS3, and Javascript. I also have experience in database systems, specifically MySQL and SQLite. I have currently started working on a [project](?page=apps) using Amazon Web Services (AWS) IAM and DynamoDB.

If you are interested to ask me about my thesis, contact me for information about my developed [applications](?page=apps), or discuss opportunities with me, you can reach me through
